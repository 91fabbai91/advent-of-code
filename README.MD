## Repository, which contains my solutions for the advent-of-code

Every day has its own folder with the same structure **one script** for solution programming and **two data files** (one for tests and other for real input)

Tasks can be found via https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/<number of day>

In my case it is the goal to test development on my android smartphone with
- **[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)**
- **[termux](https://termux.dev/en/)**
- **[Acode](https://acode.foxdebug.com/)**

and configured according to **[heise Tutorial (paywall)](https://www.heise.de/ratgeber/Anleitung-Python-Skripte-unter-Android-entwickeln-und-ausfuehren-6546277.html)**
